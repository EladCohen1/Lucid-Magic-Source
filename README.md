## Overview
Lucid Magic is a 1 vs 1 competitive card game.
Each player will choose a hero and three companions as their team for the game.
In their turn the player can use Mana points to command his companions to attack or use companion or hero special abilities.
Players must use their resources wisely to kill the enemy hero while their own stands.
The winner of the game will be the player who kills the enemy hero first.

## Lore
In a far away land, where magic and witchcraft are common, an evil witch threatens the safety of the kingdom. 
Our hero sets out to defeat the evil witch with his seven companions.
In an epic battle the witch casts a curse on our hero, sending them to an endless lucid dream. The dream is ruthless, manifesting itself as our hero’s allies.
But all is not lost! Our hero also has some control of the dream, allowing them to manifest 3 of their allies to aid them in battle against the dream.
Now, they must defeat the dream to save the kingdom.

## How To Play
Lucid Magic is meant to be played on a single computer as each player takes control in their turn.
### Draft
Before the game starts, each player will need to choose a 4 card team, 1 hero and 3 companions.
The hero is indicated by the gold border while companions are indicated by the pink border:

### Heroes
Each player’s hero will start the game with 20 points of health, 
choosing a hero card that can benefit from the increased health more than others can be a strong tactic in order to gain an edge on your opponent. 
However you must not underestimate the power of a well rounded team composition and may not want to sacrifice synergy for numerical value.
Once a hero dies, the game ends and the standing hero is declared the victor.

### Mana
On their turn, players can choose to command their cards to take actions that cost Mana points.
Each player starts the game with a maximum of 1 Mana point which will get refilled every turn.
Players can choose to expend 1 Mana point once each turn to increase their maximum Mana by 1 by using the Heroic Action: "Mana Surge".

Players can also choose to use Basic Attacks, to command a card to directly attack an enemy card, each card will take damage equal to the attack value of the opposing card.
Using a Basic Attack costs 1 Mana and each card can only use their Basic attack once per turn.
The green border around some cards indicates those cards can use a basic attack. (To use a basic attack, click and hold the left mouse button on the card you want to command to attack, then drag the target indicator to the card you wish to attack,
to execute the attack, release the button).

### Abilities
Players can expend their Mana points on card abilities, abilities can have immense influence on the outcome of the game. Smart use of abilities can be the deciding factor between victory and defeat.

### Revive Companion
When a companion dies in battle, they get sent to the graveyard. Players can choose to use the "Revive Companion" Heroic Action in order to return them to the fray.

### Battlefields
Combat will take place in one of 3 possible environments each with different effects. The game will always begin on the mountains area, which is an open area without many obstacles thus having to special effect. However after each 2-turn cycles the dream will morph the battlefield, changing the environment randomly between the 3 possible environments:
* Mountains - no effect
* Forest - characters receive 1 less damage from all sources
* Nightmare - at the end of each turn cycle all characters take 1 damage
Using the environment to your advantage can be the difference between victory and defeat.


Choosing the correct team for the job is just as important as strategic use of heroic actions, card abilities and basic attacks. Only once you master the art of combat within the dream, can you truly hope to break out of it.
Good luck heroes.
And sweet dreams.
