## Lore
In a far away land, where magic and witchcraft are common, an evil witch threatens the safety of the kingdom. 
Our hero sets out to defeat the evil witch with his seven companions.
In an epic battle the witch casts a curse on our hero, sending them to an endless lucid dream. The dream is ruthless, manifesting itself as our heroâ€™s allies.
But all is not lost! Our hero also has some control of the dream, allowing them to manifest 3 of their allies to aid them in battle against the dream.
Now, they must defeat the dream to save the kingdom.

## How To Play
Lucid Magic is meant to be played on a single computer as each player takes control in their turn.
Before the game starts, each player will need to choose a 4 card team, 1 hero and 3 companions:

The hero is indicated by the gold border while companions are indicated by the pink border.

On their turn, players can choose to command their cards to take actions that cost Mana points.
Each player starts the game with a maximum of 1 Mana point which will get refilled every turn.
Players can choose to expend 1 Mana point once each turn to increase their maximum Mana by 1 by using the Heroic Action: "Mana Surge".

Players can also choose to use Basic Attacks, to command a card to directly attack an enemy card, each card will take damage equal to the attack value of the opposing card.
Using a Basic Attack costs 1 Mana and each card can only use their Basic attack once per turn.
The green border around some cards indicates those cards can use a basic attack. (To use a basic attack, click and hold the left mouse button on the card you want to command to attack, then drag the target indicator to the card you wish to attack,
to execute the attack, release the button).

Players can expend their Mana points on card abilities, abilities can have immense influence on the outcome of the game. Smart use of abilities can be the deciding factor between victory and defeat.

When a companion dies in battle, they get sent to the graveyard. Players can choose to use the "Revive Companion" Heroic Action in order to return them to the fray.

Choosing the correct team for the job is just as important as strategic use of heroic actions, card abilities and basic attacks. Only once you master the art of combat within the dream, can you truely hope to break out of it.
Good luck heroes.
And sweet dreams.
